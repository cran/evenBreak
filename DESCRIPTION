Description: We quantitatively evaluated the assertion that says if one suit is found to be evenly distributed among the 4 players, the rest of the suits are more likely to be evenly distributed. Our mathematical analyses show that, if one suit is found to be evenly distributed, then a second suit has a slightly elevated probability (ranging between 10% to 15%) of being evenly distributed. If two suits are found to be evenly distributed, then a third suit has a substantially elevated probability (ranging between 30% to 50%) of being evenly distributed.This package refers to methods and authentic data from Ely Culbertson <https://www.bridgebum.com/law_of_symmetry.php>, Gregory Stoll <https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/bridge/math.html>, and details of performing the probability calculations from Jeremy L.
